## Installation and Local Dev Setup
To run VisualIChing locally, follow these steps:


### 1. Clone the repository

Open your terminal and navigate to whatever parent directory you'd like to clone this Git repo into.
This example assumes you will add this repo directly to your Desktop.

```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visualiching.git
```


### 2. Change into the project directory

```
cd visualiching
```


### 3. Create and activate a virtual environment

You can use any environment manager you prefer (conda, pyenv, etc.), and name the environemnt anything you'd like. For simplicity, this example uses the Python-native venv environment manager.

```
python -m venv visualiching_env
source visualiching_env/bin/activate
```


### 4. Upgrade pip and install the required dependencies

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 5. Create a .env file to store your dev environment variables

Your .env file should live in the top-level directory of the project (same as the manage.py file) and must include the following variables:

| Environment Variable | API Provider | Which Services/Features This Variable is Required For |
| -- | -- | -- |
| SECRET_KEY | N/A | REQUIRED: for local hosting; you can generate one easily at [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/) |
| DEBUG_FLAG | N/A | REQUIRED: for `settings.py` config handling, should be set to `True` |
| WORKING_ENV | N/A | REQUIRED: for `settings.py` config handling, should be set to `dev` |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) | OPTIONAL: AIService (AI-Assisted Interpretations), any net-new AI feature |
| VISUALICHING_SENDGRID_API_KEY | [Sendgrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/) | OPTIONAL: Reset Password, any net-new email notification feature |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/) | OPTIONAL: Stripe Checkout inegration |
| STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY | [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/) | OPTIONAL: Stripe Checkout integration |
| STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET | [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/) | OPTIONAL: Stripe Checkout integration |
| STRIPE_LOCAL_LISTENER_SECRET | [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/) | OPTIONAL: Stripe Checkout integration |

You can use the .envexample file in this repo as a template.

*Note: You are responsible for creating and configuring any accounts and API keys for local use and/or development on the features you wish to modify.*


### 6. Set up a local 'dev' database

This automatically creates a sqlite database in the top-level directory of the project and creates all of the models necessary for running VisualIChing.

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

*Note: If you would prefer using your own Postgres database instead, you can first add a record in the .env file for the DATABASE_URL variable, set to the database connection URL for your pgdb, and VisualIChing will automatically use that connection instead of creating a local sqlite database. This is the type of database connection used in production.*


### 7. Create a superuser for admin control over your local database:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```


### 8. Pre-populate your dev database with dev dummy data, including Users, Credits, Readings, and all the core data models (Hexagrams, HexagramLines, Trigrams, Line Types)

```
python visual_i_ching_app/devtools/add_dummy_data.py
```


### 9. Collect static files to serve up locally

```
python manage.py collectstatic
```


### 10. Start the development server

```
python manage.py runserver
```

See [this Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#runserver) for more information on running a local server.

### 11. Open VisualIChing locally

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access VisualIChing locally. You can login using the superuser credentials you created in step 7.
