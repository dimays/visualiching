Initial Hexagram: 
The Creative (Upper Trigram: The Creative, Lower Trigram: The Creative)

Initial Hexagram Description: 
The first hexagram consists of six unbroken lines representing primal power that is light-giving, active, strong, and spiritual. It is characterized by strength and lacks weakness, embodying power and energy. Its symbol is heaven, and its energy is seen as unrestricted motion in time. The hexagram encompasses the power of time and persistence. It has a dual interpretation: in relation to the universe, it signifies the strong and creative action of the Deity, while in relation to the human world, it represents the creative action of wise individuals, rulers, or leaders who awaken and develop the higher nature of others.

Initial Hexagram Judgment:
The Creative works sublime success, 
Furthering through perseverance.

Initial Hexagram Judgemnt Description:
Drawing this oracle signifies that success will come from the depths of the universe, depending on one's perseverance in doing what is right. The attributes are paired and have specific meanings. The word "sublime" refers to the generating power of the Creative, which permeates all things. Success is linked to the ability to give form to ideas, represented by the image of clouds and rain. In the human world, these attributes guide the great person towards notable success by understanding cause and effect and completing the necessary steps. Time becomes a means of actualizing potential. Conservation is seen as continuous actualization and differentiation of form. Furthering and persevering are associated with creating harmony and bringing peace and security to the world. The attributes are also connected to the cardinal virtues: love, morals, justice, and wisdom. These speculations formed a bridge between different philosophical systems, leading to intricate number symbolism over time.

Initial Hexagram Image:
The movement of heaven is full of power. 
Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.

Initial Hexagram Image Description:
This hexagram is a result of doubling the trigram qi√°n, which signifies the movement of heaven. Each day is seen as a repetition of the trigram, indicating the concept of time. The continuous movement of heaven reflects an unending duration both within and beyond time. This enduring power is the image of the Creative. The sage learns from this image and strives to develop himself, ensuring his influence persists. He strengthens himself by consciously eliminating anything inferior or degrading. By limiting the scope of his activities, he attains tirelessness and lasting impact.

Changing Lines:
Line 1: Hidden dragon. Do not act. | In Chinese culture, the dragon symbolizes a powerful force associated with thunderstorms. In winter, this energy lies dormant, but it becomes active again in early summer, representing the reawakening of creative forces on Earth. The dragon also represents a humble and resilient person who remains true to themselves, unaffected by external success or failure. Such individuals possess inner strength and patiently wait for their abilities to be recognized. Those who seek guidance from the oracle and receive this message should stay calm, strong, and patient. The fulfillment of time is certain, so there is no need to fear one's willpower. It is important not to exhaust energy prematurely by forcing the attainment of something that is not yet ready.
Line 3: All day long the superior man is creatively active. At nightfall his mind is still beset with cares. Danger. No blame. | A person gains influence and fame when others are drawn to them. Their inner strength matches their actions. Despite carrying responsibilities and worries while others rest, they must be cautious now. The risk lies in giving in to popular desires and losing integrity. Ambition has destroyed many great individuals. However, true greatness remains untarnished by temptations. Those who stay attuned to the changing times and requirements wisely avoid pitfalls, preserving their honorable character.

Resulting Hexagram:
Conflict (Upper Trigram: The Creative, Lower Trigram: The Abysmal)

Resulting Hexagram Description:
The conflict arises when the upper trigram, representing heaven, moves upward, while the lower trigram, symbolizing water, naturally moves downward. This divergence creates a sense of conflict. The Creative is associated with strength, while the Abysmal is associated with danger and guile. When cunning is backed by power, conflict ensues. Another sign of conflict is found in a person who possesses deep cunning internally and unwavering determination outwardly. Such an individual is likely to be quarrelsome.

Resulting Hexagram Judgment:
Conflict. You are sincere
And are being obstructed.
A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.
Going through to the end brings misfortune.
It furthers one to see the great man.
It does not further one to cross the great water.

Resulting Hexagram Judgemnt Description:
Conflict arises when someone believes they are right but encounters opposition. If they are uncertain of their righteousness, opposition leads to cunning or forceful encroachment, not open conflict. When caught in a conflict, the only way out is to be clear-minded and internally strong, always ready to compromise with the opponent. Persisting in a conflict to the bitter end, even when in the right, has negative consequences as it perpetuates enmity. It is crucial to recognize the importance of a great person, an impartial figure with enough authority to resolve the conflict amicably or ensure a just decision. During times of strife, it is best to avoid risky endeavors, symbolized by crossing the great water, as they require unified focus to succeed. Internal conflicts weaken the ability to overcome external dangers.

Resulting Hexagram Image:
Heaven and water go their opposite ways:
The image of Conflict.
Thus in all his transactions the superior man
Carefully considers the beginning.

Resulting Hexagram Image Description:
Conflict arises from the opposing tendencies within the two trigrams. Once these tendencies manifest, conflict becomes unavoidable. To prevent it, thorough consideration is necessary from the outset. By precisely defining rights and duties or by aligning the spiritual inclinations of individuals in a group, the root cause of conflict can be preemptively eliminated.
